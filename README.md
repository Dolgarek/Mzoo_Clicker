# Mzoo_Clicker

My first iteration with the aim of creating a game engine for 2D clicker.

The main goal is to understand the process of creation of an engine and get the idea of a skelton for my next game.

The sub goal is to create a clicker game for my friends to play.

The worst feature for me will be the one related to network since I never tried anything like that in c++.

Dunno why i'm actually typping this since no one should ever be reading this but meh

If anyone appart from read this please close my computer and return it to me i surely forgot it somewhere.
